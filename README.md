# SwiftFPR (Forward Plus Renderer)

## Overview

SwiftFPR is an exemplary implementation demonstrating the utilization of the Swift graphics library for developing a Forward Plus Renderer (FPR). Built on top of Swift, it showcases the efficiency and speed achievable through Vulkan-based rendering techniques.

## Purpose

The primary aim of SwiftFPR is to exhibit the capabilities of Swift in facilitating the development of high-performance rendering engines, specifically in the context of Forward Plus Rendering. By leveraging Swift's Vulkan abstractions and modular design, SwiftFPR demonstrates how to efficiently implement rendering pipelines for real-time graphics applications.

## Features

- **Forward Plus Rendering**: SwiftFPR showcases a Forward Plus Rendering technique, known for its ability to efficiently handle large numbers of lights in complex scenes.

- **Integration with Swift**: Demonstrates seamless integration with the Swift graphics library, utilizing its Vulkan abstractions and event system to simplify the rendering process.

- **Performance Benchmarking**: Provides performance benchmarks to showcase the speed and efficiency achieved through the SwiftFPR implementation.

## Getting Started
